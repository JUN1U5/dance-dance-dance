In this Advanced Level Honors Class, dancers are trained in modern, improvisation, and jazz technique. This pre-college performance company is responsible for all AHS Dance Concerts and Community Outreach Events. Dancers train and hone their skills throughout the year with excellence in composition, choreography, and performance.

### What do I need for class?
Dress out clothes - Appropriate clothing for dance is loose fitting and safe to move in. Clothing will need to follow the dress code, i.e. sweatpants, nike shorts, tee-shirts, leggings, etc.  Jeans are not allowed (button and zipper). Students will be responsible for bringing dance clothes everyday. Dancers should provide their own hair ties and will be dancing barefoot during class

During Guest Artist Weeks ADCompany Members are expected to wear all black athletic clothing to class.

Dance Journal - Students will need a notebook/folder (any style will do) with loose leaf lined paper inside (used for readings, reflections, feedback, and notes).

Personal Water Bottle - Students can refill their water bottles everyday in the dance room. Water breaks will be given and are highly encouraged.

### Classroom Expectations & Procedures:
When entering the room, take off your shoes and socks inside the door under the whiteboards. Leave your backpacks/belongings in the dressing rooms or cubbies.
Students should arrive dressed out and will receive 3 minutes at the end of class to change back into other clothes. 
The bell still dictates your timeliness- please be inside before the bell rings at 7:25!

### Class Expectations: Dance is a Privilege!
Show up & Listen! Be here! Be on time! Be changed out! Be present!
Bless up & Dance! Serve as a blessing to others - always! Everything you do should be in the direction of building each other up and responding to YOUR education, YOUR future. 
Clean up & Better the Space! When class is over, pick up your things and leave the classroom in better condition than you found it. 

### Class Fees & Experiences (2024-2025)
Class Fees: Dance Company has a Class Fee of $150. This fee can be submitted online via our Venmo @apexhsdanceprogram or Square Account QR, check addressed to the AHS Dance Boosters, or cash to Mrs. Brady during the school day. Please reach out to me if you need assistance with this fee.

Fall Semester $75 due September 14; Spring Semester $75 due January 24.

Experiences: Your class fee goes towards the semi-annual Guest Artist Week where Mrs. Brady brings in professional dancers in the field to teach and set workshops on AHS Dancers; it also funds all Costumes, props, your own personal ADCompany Parade Jacket, and Semester Residency Weeks.

### Absences
Because class participation is such a large part of the grade in dance, students will lose points from their Participation grade due to absences. Students MUST communicate with Mrs. Brady about absences and tardies at least a week in advance. Students may ASK for make-up work to get credit for all missed classes within two weeks of the absence. See AHS Dance Program Handbook for more information on absences.
