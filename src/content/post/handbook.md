## Student Behavior

As a member of the AHS Dance Program, dancers are expected to act professionally during and outside of class.  
You are a team – dancers will be expected to show respect and consideration for all classmates at all times. Gossiping between and about other dancers will NOT be tolerated. Leave your problems at the door – we are here to dance.

If Mrs. Brady is approached by Apex Faculty about the disrespectful behavior of a dancer in the program, disciplinary action will be taken and dancers may be removed from an Honors Course or Performance Opportunity. Mrs. Brady reserves the right to remove any dancer for ANY reason from a performance or course.

Remember that you are a representative of AHS Dance outside of school as well. It is important that dancers always represent AHS in a positive manner - this includes at school, at your studios, on field trips and even online.

ADC + HE3/4: Anyone committing a level 2 offense on the discipline matrix (having to speak with an administrator) will be put on probation or removed from the performance company. All other discipline issues will be determined on a case by case basis. If a student is in ISS or suspended he/she will be removed from the performance company.

## Class Expectations

All dancers are expected to come to class on time with proper dance attire including dress out clothes. All dancers are expected to dress out in a timely manner – not socialize in the dressing room or bathrooms. Dancers will be marked tardy if found socializing during dress out time at the end of class.

Honors Dancers should wear their hair neatly pulled back away from their face. Double french braids are not permitted during class.

## Academics/Grades

All Dance Classes follow the same grade weighting.
50% - Weekly Participation Grades
20% - Skills Assessments/Projects
20% - Journals/Essays
10% - Quizzes/Homework

Concerts/Performances are mandatory and must be attended on the assigned date.

Written Work/Class Assignments that are turned in late can be made up within a one-week window for a reduction of 10% in grade. After one week has passed, the work will not be accepted.

ADC: All students must maintain a C average or above in ALL classes at ALL times. A grade of D or F will result in probation or dismissal from the company.

### Attendance Policy

Dancers are allowed 8 or fewer class absences per semester. Missing more than 8 class periods during a semester may result in removal from dances or performances which could affect your grade.

Dancers are given 3 “Grace Days” per semester. Grace Days (or observation days) are defined as days where the dancer is exempt from the activities done in class that day. Dancers are still responsible for making up work and observing the class during instruction. This does not equal skipping class.

Students can elect to take an observation day during any point in the semester WITH THE EXCEPTION of major movement test days (at least a week notice if on test day), concert weeks, or back to back days. Grace Days are given at the discretion of the teacher and student. If more than 3 Grace Days are taken by the student, Mrs. Brady reserves the right to remove a dancer from performances and this could affect your grade.

NO class absences will be allowed on the day of a performance except in the case of an emergency. Violation of the attendance policy may result in probation or removal from the course or company.

It is common practice to message Mrs. Brady on BAND if you are going to be absent AT LEAST a week in advance. If you are absent and do not communicate with Mrs. Brady, you may be removed from aspects of performance and this could affect your grade.

In case of injury or illness, parents, dancers, and Mrs. Brady will approve a plan for the recovery time.

### Dress Code

All students are required to follow dress code when dressing out for class. This means proper length shorts and appropriate shirts.

ADC + Dance 3/4: In addition, students will be required to purchase the following items to wear for performances: black standard leotard, black spandex shorts (no logos or text), black leggings, and skin tone convertible tights . Students should have these items 1 week before the first performance.

### Illness & Injury Policy

Only students with a doctor’s note will be excused from dancing during class outside of Grace Days. Please make sure you bring a copy of your doctor’s note to Mrs. Brady.

Injury/Illness is determined on a case-by-case basis with proper communication to Mrs. Brady.

### Apprenticeship & Performance Roles

ADC + HE3/4: Students that have been offered an apprenticeship role in the company are in a learning role. They will take class with a heavy focus on technique and performance improvement. However, all performance roles must be earned regardless of status within the company. All roles will be determined on a case by case basis with emphasis on good behavior and proper technique. No dancer is guaranteed a performance role.

### Student Choreography

Student choreography is an opportunity that gives students the chance to create their own work. I expect to see well thought out ideas and choreography from students that choose to create work for the Winter and Spring Concerts. This means students are responsible for choosing an appropriate and cohesive idea, music, choreography, and costume.
Students will also need to give the teacher a rough sketch of the costume and dance idea before beginning work. Students are responsible for teaching their choreography to their casts on their designated days. Pieces that are not given 100% by their choreographers may be pulled from the show.

### Concert & Costume Expectations

All dancers are expected to arrive to all performances and rehearsals on time and prepared to dance. Excessive tardiness will result in probation. We understand that there is always a chance of illness or death in the family and will deal with these situations on a case by case basis. If something of this nature comes up and a student cannot attend a performance, please contact the teacher before the concert to inform the teacher of the circumstances.

Nail polish, acrylics or fake nails, and excess jewelry are prohibited during Concert Weeks. If a dancer is involved in lifts or stunts in the concert, the status of jewelry/nails can be a risk for safety. Please remove fake nails or clip them down to the fingertip length and use clear or nude nail polish only. French tips are permitted. Piercings must be removed. If you cannot take it out, do not get it pierced.

Tattoos are permitted but highly encouraged to be thoroughly healed before concert weeks and performances.

All major hair color/cut changes should be approved by Mrs. Brady during the year.

We are proud to be able to provide most costumes for performances and therefore treat our costumes with great care – we expect the same from the dancers when using AHS costumes.

Dancers are required to keep up with all costume pieces and maintain a neat presentation of costumes. Disregard for costume storage and maintenance will result in a loss of performance opportunity, loss of points on a performance grade and/or a possible fee to replace the costume.

### Field Trips

Field Trips are not required but are encouraged. All field trip expenses must be paid before taking the field trip. If fees are not paid, the student may not attend the field trip. In the event of last minute cancellation, the dance program will not be able to refund any fees initially paid. In addition, students with averages below a C in any class at the time of the field trip may experience restrictions during the field trip.

### Probation

Probation occurs when any of the above criteria are not met. During probation, students may be excluded from performances and field trips at the teacher’s discretion. Multiple instances resulting in probation may result in removal from the company.

Performance or Company Probation can occur at any time as decided upon by Mrs. Brady. Parent meetings can be requested if the probation persists past 4 days.

### Parent Email Contact

We will notify parents of fundraisers, field trips, deadlines, volunteer opportunities, fundraisers, and other important correspondence through email and BAND. Please make sure we have a valid email address for your family in order to avoid any miscommunication. For quick updates, please follow us on Instagram @apexhsdanceprogram or follow the Apex High School Dance Program Facebook page to see our posts.

Class Fees are required by each course in order to support the professional development of all students. These fees cover our Semi-Annual Guest Artist Weeks, Costumes for Concerts, photography + videography for concerts, and Residency weeks. These are non refundable fees.
